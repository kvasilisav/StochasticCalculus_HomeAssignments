# Stochastic Calculus Home Assignments

This repository contains two home assignments for the Stochastic Calculus course, **School of Quants**. 

## Homework 1, Option Pricing

In this assignment I:
- Developed a Python implementation to price a derivative that pays off $$S_T^5 - K$$ (if $$S_T > K$$) and zero otherwise. I utilized Itô’s lemma and compared my analytical results with Python numerical simulations.
- Priced at-the-money call and put options for stock using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. I gathered historical stock price data to estimate volatility and selected an appropriate risk-free rate for the model.

## Homework 2

In this assignment I:
- Explored the properties of Brownian motion and the Itô integral by simulating various paths and comparing the sample statistics with analytical results.
- Applied process transformations with Itô’s lemma, derived the distributions of modified processes, and conducted simulations to illustrate the behavior of these stochastic processes.
- Solved typical stochastic models, including the Vasicek model, by deriving analytical expressions for expectations and variances, and then validated them against simulation results. I also estimated AR(1) processes from real data and interpreted the model parameters.
